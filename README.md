# Electric-Car-Population
Electric automobiles have grown in popularity over the last decade as more people appreciate the need to lower carbon emissions and battle climate change. Electric vehicles are a more environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to typical gasoline-powered automobiles, and their popularity has been aided by government incentives and technological breakthroughs. Consequently, the number of electric vehicles on the road worldwide has continuously increased, and this trend is projected to continue in the coming years.
